This folder holds the contents of the IRS practice module from Jan 2022 to June 2022, which is part of the requirements to attaining the Masters of Technology.

In this module, we will be using rules-based systems and fuzzy inference systems. 
We are still considering if we should also use neuro-fuzzy systems.

I have finished coding the forward chaining Crisp Rule Inference Engine and will upload it here soon. Now, I'm evaluating fuzzy inference open-source packages and evaluating if I should use those with my custom coded inference engine or just code a fuzzy engine from scratch. The classic make-or-buy decision!
