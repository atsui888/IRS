In this module, we will be using a forward chaining rule engine and combining it with a fuzzy inference systems. 

Forward chaining (or forward reasoning) is one of the two main methods of reasoning when using an inference engine and can be described logically as repeated application of modus ponens. Forward chaining is a popular implementation strategy for expert systems, business, and production rule systems. Forward chaining starts with the available data and uses inference rules to extract more data (from an end user, for example) until a goal is reached. The name "forward chaining" comes from the fact that the inference engine starts with the data and reasons its way to the answer. 

Because the data determines which rules are selected and used, this method is called data-driven. 

One of the advantages of forward-chaining over backward-chaining is that the reception of new data can trigger new inferences, which makes the engine better suited to dynamic situations in which conditions are likely to change.
